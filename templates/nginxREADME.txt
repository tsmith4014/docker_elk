Setting up Nginx as a reverse proxy for Elasticsearch:

Install Nginx on your machine. On Ubuntu, you can do this with sudo apt-get install nginx.

Create a new Nginx configuration file for Elasticsearch. You might create a new file at /etc/nginx/sites-available/elasticsearch.

server {
listen 80;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:9200;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }

}

Enable the new configuration by creating a symbolic link to it in the sites-enabled directory: sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/elasticsearch /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/.

Test the configuration to make sure there are no syntax errors: sudo nginx -t.

If the configuration test is successful, reload Nginx to apply the changes: sudo systemctl reload nginx.

Now, you should be able to access Elasticsearch through Nginx on port 80. Remember, this setup does not include SSL/TLS or authentication. You should consider adding these for additional security.
